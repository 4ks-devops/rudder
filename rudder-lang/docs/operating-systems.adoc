= Operating systems

== Syntax

=== OS list construction

* Underscore is used as a separator `_`
* 4 accuracy layers, all following this syntax rule:
** `system` -> `linux`, etc
** `os` -> `ubuntu`, etc
** `os_major` -> `ubuntu_20`, etc
** `os_major_minor` -> `ubuntu_20_04`, etc

=== Language syntax

Since _rudder-lang_ OS list is composed of `enums`, it meets the requirements that are specific to `enums`:

- a top layer, that is the `global enum system`
- _sub-enums_ that expand their parent item: `items in linux` or `items in ubuntu_20`
- _aliases_ can be used to define any sub-enum, like: `enum alias focal = ubuntu_20_04` 

More about xref:syntax.adoc#enums[enums]

== Usage
_rudder-lang_ makes use of an exhaustive list of operating systems, including major and minor versions. +
This list is defined in the *stdlib* (more about it here: xref:stdlib.adoc[stdlib])

For now they are used in _conditions_ to check whether a method should be applied or not.

Several degrees of accuracy can be chosen when defining a condition:

- _system_ (kernel): `windows`, `linux`, `bsd`, etc
- _operating system_: `ubuntu`, `windows_server`, etc
- _major version_: for example, `ubuntu_20`
- _minor version_: for example, `ubuntu_20_04`

Yet any _sub-enum_ is a standalone, meaning it is directly defined on its own: `ubuntu_20`.

NOTE: The fact `ubuntu_20` is part of `ubuntu` -> `linux` -> `system` is only important for accuracy sake: `if linux` evaluates to true on `ubunutu_20`

=== Example with `ubuntu_20_10` as the targetted OS

The following expressions will be evaluated to `true`:

- `if linux`
- `if ubuntu` 
- `if ubuntu_20`

The following expressions will be evaluated to `false`:

- `if windows`
- `if ubuntu_20_04`
