= API documentation

== Usage (openapi/redoc)

Building the doc requires installing:

```
npm install -g redoc-cli @redocly/openapi-cli
```

* `openapi-cli` builds a single openapi file from the sources
* `redoc-cli` produces the HTML output from the openapi file

Then run:

```
make
```

And the resulting files will be in `target/`.

== Sources

The sources are in `{component}/sources/api-doc`. The main file is `openapi.src.yml`.
It is then read and modified by the build process to add the documentation
from the markdown file in `info/description`.

Each Rudder branch contains the sources of the docs for the APIs introduced in
its version.

If a Rudder branch introduced several version, the latest one should be named
`openapi.src.yml`, and previous ones `openapi-VERSION.src.yml`
(to allow easier upmerge of changes).
