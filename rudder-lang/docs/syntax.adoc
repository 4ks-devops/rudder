== Keywords

The following keywords currently have the functionality described
Sorted by category

* header:
** `@format`, defines the _rudder-lang_ version of the file.
* enum:
** `enum`, a list of values
** `global`, usage: paired with `enum`. Means enum values are unique and can be guessed without specifying a type
** `items` (`in`), sub-enums ie. extends an existing enum
** `alias`, gives an other name to an enum item
** `default`, defines a default behavior in an enum expression
* types:
** `string`, cf: <<string-type, string type>>
** `num`, cf: <<num-type, num type>>
** `boolean`, cf: <<boolean-type, boolean type>>
** `struct`, cf: <<struct-type, struct type>>
** `list`, cf: <<list-type, list type>>
** `declare`

== Operators

* `@` declares a metadata which is a key / value pair (syntax is `@key=value`)
* `##` rest of the line is a comment. Note: comments are considered to be metadatas
* `|` or, `&` and, `!` not
