= Rudder language

alias _rudder-lang_

== Preface

=== Language Presentation

This language is not:

* a general purpose language
* a Turing-complete language
* an imperative language

It has no:

* recursion
* generator / generic iterator
* way of looping except on finite list

This language is an _Open Source_  _DSL_ (_domain-specific language_) targeted at *state definition*.
Everything that is not a state definition is a convenience for easier definition of a state.
The compiler is very pedantic to avoid defining invalid states as much as possible.

File extension is `rl` for *Rudder Language*.

Example:

.ntp.rl
[source,rudder-lang]
----
include::examples/ntp.rl[]
----

Once compiled to _CFEngine_ code:

.ntp.rl.cf
[source,cfengine]
----
include::examples/documentation_ntp.rl.cf[]
----
// TODO: comparison with CFEngine, Puppet (mgmt ?)

=== Abilities as of Rudder 6.1

==== Purpose

_rudder-lang_ purpose is to be the only technique generator tool (be it CFEngine, DSC, or JSON format)
both as the _Technique Editor_ backend and as a language admins system can directly code in. 

==== Present abilities

_rudder-lang_ has just been deployed on _Rudder_ alongside the 6.1 version as an alpha tool.

Currently it works in parallel with the main _NCF_ technique generator. However it has no incidence on the user since it is only called for testing purposes.

How it is being used with _Rudder_ is explained in details (<<integration,here>>)

But what is _rudder-lang_ (and _rudderc_) already able to do?

- Generate techniques written in _rudder-lang_ into: _CFEngine_
- Translate techniques written in _JSON_ into: _rudder-lang_

These abilities make use of the following features:

* A functional *parser*
* Variables based on a *type system* composed of strings, integers, booleans, structs, lists
* A proper and contextualized *error handler* (helping you to write _rudder-lang_)
* _rudder-lang_ *libraries*, automatically generated based on the last _rudder_ version, including:
** Supported OSes
** Available resources (and their relative states)
** Reserved namespaces
* Sugar features such as:
** Aliases
** Expressions and statements
** Metadata
** Comments
* Usage of parameters and configuration files (technique names and paths as input and output, libraires paths etc)
* *Logs* generation, including log output settings like verbosity or format

==== Short-term future abilities

* Generate techniques written in _rudder-lang_ into: _DSC_
* Generate techniques written in _rudder-lang_ into: _JSON_
* Error feedback directly in the _Technique Editor_
* Enhanced (or refactored):
** Variable handling (for example in conditions)
** _CFEngine_ generation

==== Long-term future abilities

* New keywords including the _action_, _measure_, _function_ keywords
* Fully rewrite the ncf library into a self-sufficient _rudder-lang_ library
* Plain integration and usage of _rudder-lang_ into _Rudder_ whether as code or into the _Technique Editor_
* Various improvements and some reworks
