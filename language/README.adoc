== Doc

To build the doc:

=== Lib generation

Rudder lang states and resources libraries are generated from the parsing of the ncf repository.
To generates the libraries, the parsing starts from the methods metadata, and produce a Json
describing each resource and states found under it.

To generate the libraries and see the resulting Json run:

---
python tools/generate_lib_bis.py tools/rudderc-dev.conf
---

Resulting libraries will be available in `libs/std/`, the Json is the output of the command.
