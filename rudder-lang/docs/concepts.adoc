= Concepts

== Resource

- a resource is an object that sits on the system being configured
- a resource is defined by a resource type with 0 or more parameters
- a resource type with 0 parameter defines a unique resource in the system
- a resource can contain other resources

== State

- a state is an elementary configuration of a resource
- a state is defined by a name and 0 or more parameter
- a given resource can have many states at the same time
- a given resource can only have one state of a given name
- state application produces a status also named `result`

== Variables and types

- configurations can be parametered via constants and variables
- constants and variables have a type
- types are distinct from resource and state
- types are all based on basic types: `integer`, `float`, `string`, `boolean`, `array`, `hashmap`
- a variable cannot contain a resource or a state

== Enums and conditions

- an enum is an exhaustive list of possible values
- an enum mapping maps all possible values of an enum to another enum
- a condition is an enum expression
- an enum expression is a boolean expression of enum comparison
- enum comparison compares a variable with an enum value with mapping knowledge
- state application outcome are enums too
- a `case` is a list of conditions that must match all possible cases exactly once
- an `if` is a single condition
