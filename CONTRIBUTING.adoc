= How to contribute to Rudder

Rudder is open to all kinds of contribution:

* Bug reports and fixes
* Documentation
* Features ideas
* New features

If you want to contribute, the best way to start is to come and chat with us
on https://chat.rudder.io[chat.rudder.io].

NOTE: Large contributions on Rudder may require a https://www.rudder.io/en/expand/contribute/#panel-2422-8-0-1[CLA/CCLA].

== Documentation contribution

Just click on the "Edit page" button, and open a pull request directly from Github's interface!

== Development workflow

We maintain several Rudder major versions in separate branches.

* `branches/rudder/5.0` is Rudder 5.0, from which 5.0 minor release will be tagged
* `master` is the next Rudder version, not branched yet

NOTE: Some tooling repositories only have a `master` branch.

All bug fixes should be done in the oldest relevant branch (i.e.
affected and still maintained).
Version status is visible on https://docs.rudder.io/version.
Don't hesitate to ask us on the https://chat.rudder.io[chat room] if you are unsure about which
branch you should work on.

We have an internal CI platform running Jenkins, integrated to Github pull requests.
CI configuration is mostly done trough `Jenkinsfile` files in the repositories.

=== Issue tracker

We do not use Github's issue tracking but an external issue tracker hosted on
https://issues.rudder.io.

Every change in one of the Rudder repositories must be linked to an issue in this
tool, except for documentation fixes that can be contributed directly on
Github.

=== Development tooling (rudder-dev)

==== Installation

To ease the use of a separate issue tracker and maintenance of several
branches of Rudder, we have developed a dedicated tooling.

To download rudder-dev:

```
wget https://repository.rudder.io/tools/rudder-dev
```

It is a shell script you can put somewhere is your PATH. You can then update it with

```
rudder-dev update
```

(it will remind you to do so regularly).

=== Setup

At its first start, `rudder-dev` will create its configuration script in `~/.rudder-dev`.
You need to edit it to provide your Github and bug tracker token:

```
[default]
## Uncomment and set your own values
## To manage your tokens, click here https://github.com/settings/tokens
github_token =
## Redmine personal access token, (create one here http://issues.rudder.io/my/account)
redmine_token =
```

=== Usage

```
rudder-dev --help
```

For more information.
