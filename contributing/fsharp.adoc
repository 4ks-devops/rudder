= F# dev environment

== General information

=== Compatibility

While our F# code only runs on Windows for now, we strive to keep it compatible with Linux systems
both for ease of development/testing and future abilities.

The development environment should always work on both Windows and Linux, and try to maintain
the broadest compatibility possible (especially for agent parts).

Out builds should all target `netstandard2.0` target (with `<TargetFramework>netstandard2.0</TargetFramework>` in `fsproj` files).

== Development environment

We work with the latest LTS .NET toolchain.
Install the .NET toolchain by following the https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/[official docs].

For example, on Fedora:

```
sudo dnf install dotnet
```

Will install the latest version from the repositories.

=== IDE/Editor

VS Code with the **Ionide for F#** plugin is a good option.
