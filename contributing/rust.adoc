= Rust dev environment

The compiler version used to build the projets are
set in a `rust-toolchain` file in the project root.

We can rely on recent Rust compilers as we control the version
installed on our package builders. The easiest way to install and manage
Rust toolchains is to use https://rustup.rs[rustup].
It will install the latest stable toolchain. You can also install
specific toolchains to match what is used on our package builders.

https://areweideyet.com/[Good IDEs for Rust development] include VS Code or IntelliJ.

When using VS Code, https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer#language-server-quick-start[rust-analyzer]
is a good alternative to RLS (and avoids performance problems).

Other useful tools:

```bash
rustup component add rustfmt # to format code, use with "cargo fmt"
rustup component add clippy  # various linters, use with "cargo clippy"
cargo install cargo-audit    # to list known vulnerabilities in dependencies
cargo install cargo-outdated # to list outdated dependencies
cargo install cargo-update   # to update cargo-installed tools
cargo install cargo-tree     # to see the tree of dependencies
cargo install cargo-benchcmp # to compare benchmarks results
```
