Developers documentation
========================


This documentation is a general documentation about developments rules for Rudder-web module.


Where to start
--------------

You should have a basic understanding of the project layout, where things go.
After that, bootstrap.liftweb.Boot and bootstrap.liftweb.RudderConfig will give
you a summary of boot process, actions and services used.

Snippets pages are mapped one to one with real application pages.


Packages
--------

Describe the expected content / main class of each packages


* bootstrap.liftweb
    Here comes everything tied to application bootstrap and starting time. Mainly, it's:
    * Lift bootstrap, in **Boot.scala**
    * Spring / DI configuration (AppConfigAuth for the spring-security stuff)
    * bootstrap actions and checks.

 * com.normation.web
    Main Lift package.

    * com.normation.web.api
        REST/Saop API go here.

    * com.normation.web.components
        That package contains Snippet NOT accessible as pages, and which need to be
        instanciated in the context of an other (page) Snippet.
        See com.normation.web.PolicyInstanceManagement / com.normation.web.components.PolicyInstanceSettingForm
        for an use case.

    * com.normation.web.model
        Entity classes, only used in the web-tier.

    * com.normation.web.serices
        Service classes, only used in the web-tier

    * snippet
        Lift page classes, with the presentation look and logic.
