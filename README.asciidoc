=== Synopsis

This package is a Scala wrapper around http://www.unboundid.com/products/ldapsdk/[UnboundID LDAP SDK].
Its goal is to provide an efficient and idiomatic Scala library to deal with LDAP directories. 
The efficient part is accomplished by the great UnboundID SDK, and so we will focus on the 
idiomatic Scala construction, especially:

- providing something like the https://wiki.scala-lang.org/display/SYGN/Loan[loan pattern] 
  for LDAP connection handling;
- providing a monad API for connection (and so for operation composition);
- mainly using immutable data structures (return collection, attributes, etc);
- using Option (or Lift Box) in place of semantic null return;
- using other idiomatic Scala goodies: conversion, apply, meaningful operators (but also 
  providing full string method name), case classes, etc
- trying to keep the same hierarchy / logic as UnboundID. 

Note: the first attempt for this module was to provide a blind Scala LDAP API implementation. 
Today, it seems that for the coming years, the only stable, autonomous and efficient LDAP SDK will 
remain UnboundID's one. The OpenDS/ApacheDS project is still young, and there are no other known
alternatives. So, we choose to not try too hard to hide UnboundID, but still provide nice import scheme.
