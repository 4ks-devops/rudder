This file contains data structure that are used in API, either REST data exchange format, or configuration & fact repositories.

Be careful, any change here will likely have an impact in third party code, and so should be carefuly versioned.



Each object is formated with a file format.
Old file format must be readable so that old versionned information can be
unserialized to current domain objects.

File format must be incremented in case of breaking changes, which are:
- adding a mandatory field or transforming an optional one to mandatory. Old serialized objects may not have it.
- renaming a field (even optionnal): the new name would be looked up in old files, leading to incorrect data if it was present and non empty under the old name.
- changing the type or the multiplicity of a field

All these changes can be workarouned with adaptators (ex: default value for the new mandatory field, looking-up the old name, etc) and that's why we need a fileformat.

These changes don't need a file format increment:
- removing a mandatory field or transforming one to optionnal.
  This is ok since it means that old serialized objects will have it, just that
  now it is not required anymore.
- removing or adding optionnal fields
