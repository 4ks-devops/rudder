= Rudder language

== Language

This language is:


This language is not:

- a general purpose language
- a turing complete language
- an imperative language

It has no:

- recursion
- generator / generic iterator
- way of looping except on finite list

This language is a DSL (_domain-specific language_) targeted at *state definition*.

Everything that is not a state definition is a convenience for easier definition of a state.

The compiler is very pedantic to avoid defining invalid states as much as possible.

File extension is `rl` for *R*udder *L*anguage.

Example:

ntp.rl
[source,rl]

include::examples/ntp.rl[]
