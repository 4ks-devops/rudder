[#stdlib]
== *stdlib*
What is called _stdlib_ (_rudder-lang_ own _standard library_) is the following set of files. +
Folder: `./libs`:

=== _resourcelib.rl_
Contains the list of available methods. A method is composed of:

* a resource
* its relative states
* the resource parameters
* states own parameters

=== _corelib.rl_
Contains standard enums available to rudder-lang users like the general purpose enums `boolean` and `result`

=== _oslib.rl_
Contains the exhaustive list of supported operating systems, including major and minor versions. +
Stored in the form of nested `enum`s.

//TODO rename OS section
More about supported OSes and their usage in _rudder-lang_ here: <<operating-systems,supported OSes>>

=== _cfengine_core.rl_
Contains the exhaustive list of _CFEngine_ reserved words and namespaces. +
Required since these words cannot be created by _rudder-lang_ to avoid any conflicts with _CFEngine_.
